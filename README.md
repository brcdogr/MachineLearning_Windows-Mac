# About The Case

Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. 
Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance. 

Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. 
As such, my team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. 

My team's goal for this project is to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data as well as utilizing external research to support our findings and to give details related to details such as audience size.

Assumption: Including its demographics, this data is representative of the population Apple is attempting to study.
